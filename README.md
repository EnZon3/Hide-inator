# What is the Hide-Inator?
The Hide-Inator is Dr. Doofenshmirtz's latest invention that allows you to disguise the tab to any website (that allows embeds), essentially hiding it in plain sight!
### For Example,
Say you want to hide your algebra calculator, that looks like this: <img src="https://i.enzon3.wip.la/mathway.png"></img>

Using the Hide-Inator, you can make it look like this: <img src="https://i.enzon3.wip.la/homework.png"></img>

**Also note that if you want to play a YouTube video, you need to make it an embed first by typing in the https://youtube.com/embed/[video id]**
